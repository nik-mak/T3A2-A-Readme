### Installation
#### [Frontend](https://github.com/desperate-housewares/dh-frontend-cra.git)
1. Open the terminal
2. CD into the dh-frontend-cra directory after cloning it as above. 
3. Type into the terminal 'npm install' and wait for it to complete the installation.
4. Type into the terminal 'npm start' to start the application on your local machine.

Note: If you run into files not found when you have started the server but the components are present make sure that the directory name for the component matches the import statement. This should not effect your build if you deploy the website online using a platform such as netlify.

Note: If running locally, make sure the correct URLs are present in `src/helpers/api.js` e.g.:
```js
const api = axios.create({
  baseURL: "http://localhost:4000/api/v1",
  withCredentials: true,
  'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': 'http://localhost:4000'
});
```

#### [Backend](https://github.com/desperate-housewares/dh-backend.git)
1. Open the terminal
2. CD into the dh-frontend-cra directory after cloning it as above. 
3. Type into the terminal 'npm install' and wait for it to complete the installation.
4. Type into the terminal 'npm run dev' to start the application on your local machine.

### Create an Admin Account
To create an admin account, it will need to be done manually in the database. This is so that it's not possible to create a admin account in the browser. 

1. Open [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and navigate to your database.
2. Locate the user you wish to grant admin access to.
3. Change the role of the user from `role: "customer"` to `role: "admin"`

Note: If you run into files not found when you have started the server but the components are present make sure that the directory name for the component matches the import statement. This should not effect your build if you deploy the website online using a platform such as netlify.

### Problem Identified

People do not know what is in an op shop until they go in there, and most of the time you need to browse in several stores until you find a desired product. For convenience people trend to go to bigger op shops, which normally belong to a chain of stores, leaving only a small portion of the market share for the community stores. Due to the limited market presence and visibility, those smaller op shops sometimes end up not having enough volume of sales to become a sustainable business that continuous to support the local economy and the underprivileged customers.

### Purpose

This web application has the main purpose of giving a better market visibility to small op shops by displaying their catalogue of products to be easily accessed by their customers, who can verify online if their local store has the items they are looking for and complete the purchase for pick up, saving time and money in their purchasing process, as it eliminates the need to physically go and browse for an item in several different stores.

### Target Audience

* Customers - local community, underprivileged people
* Small op shops - administrator and general staff

### Dataflow Diagram
The dataflow diagrams (DFD) reflects the movement of data throughout the program.Rather than have one large diagram, they have been split into multiple DFDs to make understanding them easier.

They have been broken down to specific processes:
- Customer/User
- Staff
- Manager/Admin
- Login/Sign Up
- Cart


The customer/user DFD follows the processes required for the basic usage of the app; Viewing the items, adding the items to their cart, and placing the items on hold. In order for a customer to add an item to their cart they are required to be logged in.

The cart DFD shows the processes involved in either placing an item on hold or removing all items from the cart. Once the items are placed on hold they are removed from the catalogue so they aren't visible to other customers, the items are moved into their orders, and the cart is then cleared. If the user wishes to clear their cart with placing on hold then the cart is simply cleared of all items.

The login/sign up DFD follows the process required for logging in with JWT and Bcrypt. Each step requires some form of verification (all required inputs are provided, if the user exists, etc.). Once the user is verify or the new user is signed up, the user info is stored as a session cookie and provided a token specific to the user and session which can then be accessed for the duration of the session.

The staff DFD reflects the process of adding, editing, and deleting an item. Only staff, managers, and admins have access to these features.

The manager/admin DFD shows that they are the only ones with access to the admin dashboard. The admin dashboard is the only place where the role of an account can be edited (i.e. add or remove staff). They also have access to all features available to staff.

### Wireframes

<details open>
<summary> General Design Choices </summary>
<br>

This section contains a list of wire frames for all screen widths. Each designed to be mobile first with the intention of the site being accessible to all users. For this reason the design of the website is kept simple and monochromatic to draw attention to button warnings and intended actions across the user interface. 

To keep the website design modern we have decided to use Oswald with varying weights to put emphasis on important content such as headings. Oswald belongs to the Sans-Serif typeface family which is shown to significantly improve the reading performance of individuals with dyslexia. (Luz Rello and Ricardo Baeza-Yates, Good Fonts for Dyslexia, 21 October 2013) This was another important factor in our decision to use Oswald. 


The colors chosen for the website  (excluding white and black) are red, blue and yellow or specifically #B30000, #2555AD and #FAC904 respectively. These colors have been contrast checked using web-aims online contrast checker (see webAIM Screenshots below).

A deeper discussion that outlines design choices such as but not limited to space distribution, relationship between screens (i.e. phone, tablet and desktop designs) content prioritization and intended actions/functions can be found below.

<summary> Homepage Design overview </summary>
<br>
The homepage is the first thing that the user sees when they enter the website. To emphasize the websites purpose and build reputation we have decided to implement a hero section that contains our mission statement and logo as well as an image with a dark overlay to increase contrast and draw attention to our brand's slogan.

We recognize that the navbar is the anchor point for the website and for this reason it is fixed at the top of the screen for all users so that they can quickly and easily navigate the website. In addition to this you will notice that each nav icon is clearly labelled underneath to communicate the destination point (see intended actions/functions). You will notice that we have chosen to incorporate svg icons with the goal of making the navbar more visually appealing to the stakeholders. Lastly you will notice on small device widths all nav-items except for the cart will be displayed in a hamburger menu.

Nav-Item Actions/Functions (left to right):
 - Desperate Housewares logo; will return the user to the top of the homepage.
 - Bag nav item; will render the Held Listings page.
 - Settings dropdown menu; will open the settings menu.
 - Account nav item: will open the manage account modal.
 - create listing nav item: will open the create listing modal.
 - Cart nav item: will open the shopping cart menu

We recognize that the most common way that users scan our website will follow the F-shaped pattern. For this reason we have decided to go with a standard design for the marketplace catalogue directing their eyes across a series of catalogue item cards. Each cards visual hierarchy is designed to establish the main focal point as the catalogue items image. The secondary focal point is the large "add to cart or add to hold" buttons which will either add the item to the users cart or to the users bag of holdings. It is important to note that as a part of our development process we will be using a hold system and transferring to a payment/cart system later on in the projects lifecycle. For this reason both buttons are shown in the figma designs. 

Additional design considerations that improve the user experience and build upon the sites functionality is:
1.  The "sort by" button, whose purpose is for the user to be able to sort by "price" and "recent" with the goal of adding more sorting options during future development cycles. 
2.  The manage-listing button, which will prompt the manage-listing-modal (discussed further on) and is displayed instead of the add to cart button for staff and administrators so that they can manage (edit, remove) a listing item on the catalogue.
3.  The pagination button, which is designed to improve the user experience and the load time of the website by reducing the amount of listing items required to be displayed at any given time and improve the user's the ability to navigate them.

#### Held Listings Page Design

<details open>
<summary>Held Listings Page Design overview</summary>
<br>

The held listings page is reused for both staff and shoppers and will be rendered in different ways. The differences between what are rendered includes:

1. The shoppers data will be visible for a logged in shopper. (see held listing desktop wire0frame vs tablet wire-frame)
2. The shoppers data will not be visible for a logged in staff member.
3. For shoppers only held items they have placed a hold on will be shown as cards in the held items card collection.
4. For staff, all held items in the store will be shown as cards in the held items card collection. 
5. The mark as collected button on a held item card will not be visible for shoppers and the card size will be reduced.
6. The mark as collected button will be visible for staff.
7. In place of the mark as collected button will be a remove from hold button for shoppers which will remove the card and item from the shoppers bag.

The held listings page can be accessed through the bag button for shoppers or through the settings menu option "view listings on hold" for staff. The purpose of this page is for users to be able to view the holdings relevant to them. You will notice that the design is kept simple and minimal and follows the standard "F" viewing pattern. For accessability the mark as collected button is designed to be large on each card so that the staff member can quickly process a customers hold request. 

Initially the design included a table that documented the holdings in a similar format however to make the website more responsive and reduce load times the held items were turned into cards with a pagination button for easy navigation.

<br>

The Admin Dashboard page is used by an administer to add new staff to the store using the + add staff button or remove staff from the store by clicking the remove icon on the staff card in the staff card collection. This page is designed with simplicity in mind so that in future development cycles more administrative features can be added. For consistency with all other pages this page follows the standard F pattern. You will notice the remove staff icon and button is coloured red. This is to call attention to this feature and act as a warning to the user.

<summary>Modals Design Overview</summary>
<br>

To stop the website from being content heavy we have decided to split the forms out into modals. All modals follow the general F patter with large buttons to draw attention to the corresponding actions. Each modal can be closed using the close button with the 'X' icon which is clearly labelled close to indicate it's purpose to the user. Additionally every modal follows the general format listed below with a goal fo providing consistency between modals and simplicity.

1. Header,
2. Fillable Form,
3. Submit/save buttons.

The design of these modals makes responsiveness easy to optimize for mobile screens. Lastly you will notice that all buttons are styled to emphasize warnings and draw attention to their intended function.

<summary>Menu's Design Overview</summary>
<br>

To meet the criteria of our MVP the design incorporates three menu, these are discussed below. 

**Hamburger Menu:** This menu was designed with simplicity and mobile responsiveness in mind by reducing the complexity of the navbar for mobile widths. Additionally, the position of the hamburger button used to open this menu is located on the left hand side and corresponds with the direction that the hamburger menu will be appear from.

**Settings Menu:** This menu has a similar design to the hamburger menu and is designed with simplicity and mobile responsiveness in mind. The intention of this menu is to act as a place for staff/admin navigation options to be found. On large screen widths this menu will drop down when the settings icon is clicked and for small screen widths it will push outwards like the hamburger menu.

**Shopping Cart Menu:** This menu is designed with simplicity and user experience in mind. The cart is designed to be mobile responsive and appear when the cart icon is clicked. The cart will pop out from the right hand side of the screen for desktop and over the entire screen for mobile widths. On this menu you will notice that the "place hold" button is featured twice. The intention of this is to reduce the users scroll times on small screens. In addition to this you will notice that the remove all button is highlighted red and made distinct to draw attention and act as a warning.

### Trello Board & Project Management

Trello Board: [link](https://trello.com/invite/b/BzgS0oZt/641fd4be604d47fca55fb75d6d5855c0/team-project)

For our project we decided to allocate tasks based on the teams strengths. This lead to Gisele primarily working in the backend, Nik on both ends and Ben on the front end. In addition to this we all attended daily stand up (excl weekends) where we discussed what we were working on and the cards we would be trying to finish. Once assigned a card in our daily standup we would write  our checklist fo that card and input a dude date to track our progress.In addition to this you will notice that we limited our scope significantly so we could prioritize our MVP product. The difficulty levels on each card was also displayed on our Trello Board using labels. To see our daily progress look at our Trello Board where we logged daily screenshots of our Trello Board, our minutes and our stand ups. 

For our project we have decided to use a implement kanban style Trello board with regular meetings and standups. This Kanban board is designed to be used to management the project by following the below steps. 

1. Make User Stories and other project related tasks visible on the board by adding all tasks as cards to the **Backlog** list;

2. Move the cards one-by-one to **To Do** as they becomes more fleshed out while giving preference to the highest priorities;

3. Move card to **In Progress** and assign owner name to the card;
  * Owners need to create a checklist for each of their cards (at least 5 tasks per checklist);

4. Once completed, card is moved to **Review** for final tests to see how that feature is interacting with other ones;
 
5. When tests and/or review are successful, move card to **Completed** and celebrate that win!
 
6. When deployment is achieved, move cards to **Deployed**, celebrate one more time!
 
7. Now it's time to check the **Backlog** for the next task.

Below is a series of screenshots with the progress that we have achieved thus far.

We did snapshot testing for some components on the frontend and unit testing and integration testing for components on the backed. In addition to this we also did user flow manual tests.
